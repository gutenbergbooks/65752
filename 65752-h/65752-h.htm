<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="ph3">TWELVE YEARS LATER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the early days of the present century, during which
period the events of this story took place, the education
of the lower classes was of the meagrest description;
boys like Jack Shelley, with intellectual
capacities above the level of their own class, had none
of the opportunities afforded at the present day of
rising from their humble position. Jack, indeed, was
fortunate in getting hold of Fairy’s books, which he
very soon mastered; but in those times young ladies
were taught very little besides history and geography,
and a little French, and Fairy was not fond
of study; she liked French, and she was fond of
poetry; history she hated, and but for Jack her
ignorance of arithmetic would have been pitiable.
Her taste for poetry hence fitted Jack indirectly, for
Mr. Leslie gave her a Shakespeare on her tenth
Christmas Day, and from the first day Jack caught
sight of it he never rested till he had saved up
enough money to buy himself one, which was his
constant companion on the downs. He was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">{114}</span>
intense lover of nature as well as of
poetry, and his shepherd’s life helped
him in this respect; for during the long
hours he passed daily on the lonely
downs, he had plenty of time for
observation of all the birds and
animal life he came across. Sussex is a
famous county for rare birds, and the
neighbourhood of Lewes in particular is
celebrated in this respect; and by the
time Jack was seventeen he was quite
an authority on birds; he knew all about
them, what kinds visited the neighbourhood
and at what seasons; which remained
all the year round, and which
were only rare and occasional visitors;
which bred there, where their nests were
to be found, how they were made, and
how many eggs and of what kind each
species laid; the habits and very often
the characters of different birds—all this
he knew.</p>

<p>His drawback was he could not
afford to buy any good book on birds—they
were all far beyond his means; but
Mr. Leslie had “Bewick,” and one of
Jack’s greatest treats was to go and
fetch Fairy, when she spent an evening at
the Rectory, and be allowed half an hour’s
study of this most fascinating book.</p>

<p>But besides natural history and
Shakespeare, Jack studied mathematics
on the downs; he bought an old Euclid
and an algebra in a book-shop at Lewes,
and these, with his Shakespeare and
one or two other books, he kept in a hole
in a chalk-pit on one of the downs; and
winter and summer alike, while the
sheep grazed he studied. In winter he
walked up and down to keep his blood
in circulation, for it was sometimes so
cold that he would have been frozen had
he sat still; but in summer he stretched
himself full length on the short turf in
some grey hollow, where he was in
shadow.</p>

<p>In some ways a shepherd’s life suited
him; it gave him plenty of leisure for
study; he was his own master from the
time he left home in the grey dawn till
he returned at sunset; his duties were
light, he had but to follow the sheep, and
his dog did all the hard work; moreover,
he had none of the responsibility—that
all fell on John’s shoulders. Then he
liked the loneliness of it. Often for days
he met no one except, perhaps, his
father, with the rest of the flock, or
Dame Hursey gathering wool, or some
other shepherd; but yet, for all this,
Jack hated the life. He hated it because
he felt he had the capacity in him
for doing higher work; he hated it
because, though his father was content
to live all the year on the chalky slopes,
visiting Lewes at the two sheep fairs,
and occasionally on market days, and
on the fifth of November to see the
carnival, he was not; he longed to
go beyond those round-topped mountains,
to cross that silver streak of sea
he caught a glimpse of on clear days,
to see some of the cities and places he
had read of. Above all, he hated it
because he felt it was an insuperable
obstacle between him and Fairy; for
whom, from that day when, as an infant,
she had clutched hold of his finger, he
had entertained a romantic and ardent
affection.</p>

<p>And then he was very proud; and though
it was doubtless very foolish pride, he was
ashamed of being a shepherd. He
would not have had his father, for whom
he had the greatest respect, suspect the
real secret reason of his dislike to his
occupation for worlds, but there it was
all the same. He knew to have refused
to become a shepherd would almost have
broken John Shelley’s heart; and so, for
his sake, Jack had never demurred
when it was proposed, but he cherished
hopes of some day rising to a higher
calling.</p>

<p>Poor Jack! could he but have known
how that longing was to be fulfilled!
But Jack no more than the rest of us
could afford to look into the future,
neither had he the power—it was as
mercifully veiled from him as from
others. To look back on past sorrows is
sad enough; to look forward to coming
ones with the same certainty would be
insupportable.</p>

<p>Jack’s seventeenth birthday was a
glorious day, and before the sun was
high in the horizon, he, and Fairy, and
the two other boys were on their way to
the seaside, with their dinners in a
basket. They were all in high spirits,
for a holiday was a rare thing indeed for
Jack, and Willy was nearly always at
sea, so it was a treat to have him with
them, especially to Jack, whose favourite
brother Willy was. Moreover, when Willy
was there, he would be sure to take
Charlie away for part of the day, and
leave Jack and Fairy together, and this
was a thing to be very thankful for in
Jack’s opinion, for he considered Charlie
a little nuisance, and had always been
very jealous of his brotherly affection
and friendship for Fairy. One thing
in particular annoyed Jack; Charlie
always kissed Fairy every night when
he went to bed—a thing neither he
nor his father ever ventured to do, nor
had Willy ever done so since he came
back from sea; but Charlie kissed her
every night in the coolest way; and
when Jack remonstrated with his mother,
as he sometimes did about it, Mrs.
Shelley only laughed and said as they
were foster brother and sister, and
both still mere children, it was quite
natural.</p>

<p>But this day was destined to be a very
happy one for Jack; he was the hero of
it, and Fairy gave herself up to making
it as pleasant for him as possible. Her
present had delighted him greatly, so he
started in his happiest mood. He was
lucky, too, and found a nest of a Cornish
chough in the chalky cliffs, with five little
birds, one of which Jack took home
alive and made a great pet of; then, as
they neared Newhaven, he shot a water-ousel
with his catapult, to add to his
collection of stuffed birds found in the
neighbourhood. Jack was a charming
companion on a country walk; he knew
every bird they came across, and his
delight and excitement when they saw a
rare or scarce bird was charming to
witness. A flight of crossbills, or a
ring-ousel, was a delightful incident to
Jack; and when, in the evening at Newhaven,
he actually descried a stormy
petrel skimming over the surface of the
sea in its usual business-like way, as if
all the affairs of the nation depended on
it, his delight was unbounded. He had
had a glorious birthday, he declared—only
one little shadow was cast across it on
their way home, when, as they reached
the top of the down, at the foot of which
lay the shepherd’s house, they met Dame
Hursey. Now Jack never could bear
Dame Hursey to approach Fairy! He
always connected her in some way or
other, how, he did not exactly know, with
Fairy’s arrival, and he had a very shrewd
suspicion that the old wool-gatherer
knew far more than anyone else about
Fairy’s parentage. One thing was certain—she
was most curious about the
child, and never met either Jack or his
father without talking about her, and
trying to find out something about her;
and if she could only speak to Fairy herself,
she was quite happy; but this Jack
never suffered her to do if he could prevent
it; and seeing her coming he now
tried to hurry Fairy home before Dame
Hursey could catch them up.</p>

<p>“Hi, man, Jack Shelley, stop a minute,
will you, and let me have a look at
the little lass?” shouted Dame Hursey
in her broad Sussex brogue, and Jack,
much against his will, was obliged to
stop.</p>

<p>“Poor old woman, Jack; she can’t
do us any harm; why shouldn’t we stop
and speak to her?” said Fairy, who
did not keep her pretty manners for the
other sex only, but was just as anxious
to charm an old woman like Dame Hursey,
and be as courteous to her as she
would have been to Mr. Leslie or any
of the people she met at the Rectory.</p>

<p>“Well, you are fair enough for a princess.
We shall have the prince coming
one of these fine days and carrying you
off,” said Dame Hursey, holding the
little slender fingers Fairy tendered her
in her horny old palm, and gazing with
her piercing black eyes, bright now in
spite of her seventy odd years, at the
child’s fair face.</p>

<p>“I hope not; I am very happy here,”
said Fairy, laughing.</p>

<p>“But you don’t belong here for all
that; you look as much out of your place
here as a black-faced horned sheep would
among John Shelley’s flock of Southdowns.”</p>

<p>“We must be going, Fairy. See, the
sun is setting,” said Jack, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Ah, it is no use your frowning about
it, Jack Shelley. You may take her
away now, but you mark my words, as
sure as my name is Hursey, the prince
will come and carry the fairies’ child
away one of these days, in spite of all
you can say or do to the contrary,”
persisted the old woman, as Jack led
Fairy off, feeling very much annoyed at
her words.</p>

<p>“Old witch,” muttered Jack.</p>

<p>“Poor old thing! she means well,
Jack,” laughed Fairy.</p>

<p>“I almost think she has meant mischief
to you, Fairy, ever since that day
after you first came to us, and I was left
at home to watch Charlie, while mother
took you to Mr. Leslie. I remember as
well as if it were yesterday; she came in
while you were gone, and ransacked the
place to look for your clothes and things.
If you had been in the cradle instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">{115}</span>
Charlie, I am sure she would have stolen
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, how absurd you are!
Well, at any rate, I am too big to be
stolen now, so you might let me be civil
to her.”</p>

<p>“Civil you can be, but, Fairy, promise
me you will never go to her cottage, nor
stop talking to her when you are alone,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I promise. I am not at all
anxious to go to her very dirty hut, and
mother very seldom lets me go out
alone, except to and from the Rectory.”</p>

<p>“I only wish she did; here I have to go
out with Fairy whenever she chooses,
whether I like or not,” put in Charlie.</p>

<p>“But you always do like,” said Fairy,
at which Jack frowned ominously.</p>

<p>The next week Willy went to sea, and
the others were left at home for the summer,
except Fairy, who went to the seaside
with the Leslies for a fortnight in
September, the longest fortnight Jack
ever spent. While she was away, Mrs.
Shelley took the opportunity of warning
Jack about his growing jealousy of
Charlie, which was daily becoming more
apparent, and she flattered herself when
Fairy came back that her words had had
some effect, until a little incident occurred
to show her she was mistaken.</p>

<p>One evening in November, as Jack
was coming down the High-street of
Lewes, whither he had had to accompany
his father, much against his will, to the
last sheep fair, he saw a large bird flying
slowly overhead. He followed it down a
by-street, and saw it was getting lower
and lower, evidently tired, until at last
it sunk exhausted on the ground, a few
paces from Jack, who secured it without
much difficulty. It was a wild goose
come southwards for the winter, and,
being exhausted either for want of food
or by its long journey, had become
separated from its companions. By its
black, snake-like head and neck, and
the smallness of its size in comparison
with other geese, Jack recognised it at
once as a Brent goose, and taking it up
in his arms he ran home in triumph with
his prize, which soon revived after being
fed. He clipped its wings and put it
with the rest of the poultry, where it
soon became quite at home, and attached
itself to Charlie, who always fed it, and
constantly followed him about the premises,
sometimes even into the house.</p>

<p>For some reason or other Fairy took a
dislike to this bird; she declared it looked
like an evil spirit, and she was sure it
would bring ill-luck to them. She could
not bear to see it about the garden, and
often begged Charlie in Jack’s hearing
to keep it shut up with the rest of the
poultry. Charlie, however, delighted in
having found a way of teasing Fairy, and
partly on that account, partly because
he was really fond of the bird, he encouraged
it to follow him wherever he
went.</p>

<p>One morning Charlie came in to breakfast
in the greatest distress—the Brent
goose was gone; he had searched the
premises, but could not see a sign of it.</p>

<p>“I am very glad of it. Horrid bird,
with its snaky head and neck! I hated
it,” said Fairy.</p>

<p>“Have you done anything with it,
Fairy? Do you know where it is?”
asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Ask Jack,” laughed Fairy; and that
was all Charlie could get out of her.</p>

<p>Jack was on the downs with the sheep,
and would not be home till evening, so
Charlie spent the day in searching the
neighbourhood for the Brent goose, but
in vain; and when Jack came home
Charlie’s first words were, “The Brent
goose is lost, Jack.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“I tell you it is; I have been all over
the country looking for it, and I can’t
find it anywhere.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t go to the Pells, I suppose,
did you?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>The Pells is the public garden of
Lewes—a paddock, with a piece of ornamental
water, on which live a beautiful
collection of wild ducks, belonging to the
town.</p>

<p>“No, I forgot that; how stupid of me!
It is too dark to go now,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“And no use either, though the goose
is there; I have given it to the town,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“What a shame, when I was so fond
of it! you only did it to spite me,” cried
Charlie, ready to burst into tears, only
he was too big to cry about a goose.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it to spite you; I sent it
away because Fairy hated it, and you
were always teasing her about it. If
you want to see it you can go to the
Pells every day if you like and look at it,
but I won’t have Fairy teased about it.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have Fairy teased, indeed!
Why, she is much more my sister than
yours; you have nothing to do with her;
I am her foster-brother,” broke out
Charlie.</p>

<p>For a moment Jack hesitated, and
Charlie put up his arm to ward off the
blow he seemed to expect, but on second
thought Jack only turned on his heel,
and with a bitter laugh muttered contemptuously,
“Get out of my way, and
don’t talk such stuff, you little idiot.”</p>

<p>They never understood each other,
these two brothers. While Charlie
thought Jack a book-worm who encroached
upon his relationship with
Fairy, Jack thought Charlie an idle little
boy, not over clean, who would never be
anything more than a labouring man to
the end of his days, and who had the
impertinence to consider himself on an
equality with Fairy. With Willy Jack
got on much better, though Willy was no
cleverer than Charlie, nor any fonder of
study; but then he never roused his eldest
brother’s jealousy in the way Charlie
did. Mrs. Shelley, who understood her
eldest son better than anyone else did,
always tried to ward off any collisions
between the boys, and if that were impossible,
took Jack’s part, which always
had the effect of mollifying him at once.
On this occasion she had heard the
squabble between the boys, and as Jack
went upstairs to change his clothes before
helping Fairy with her lessons, she
persuaded Charlie, who had been tramping
about the country the whole day, to
go to bed before Jack reappeared,
promising to bring him up some
supper.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Shelley could not be always
at her boy’s heels to keep the peace between
them, and as Jack grew into
manhood she watched with anxious
heart his growing passion for Fairy, and
his increasing jealousy of his youngest
brother. Under any circumstances his
love for Fairy would have made her
tremble for him, though at present
Fairy was such a child it was impossible
to say how she might feel in the future
with regard to Jack; but Mrs. Shelley
thought it far more probable the child
would meet someone at the Leslies than
that she would choose Jack, whom she had
known all her life, and whom she seemed
to regard as an elder brother. But
when added to this Jack’s jealousy of
Charlie grew side by side with his love,
like an ugly poisonous weed by the side
of a beautiful flower, Mrs. Shelley, in
spite of the comfort and joy Fairy was to
her, often regretted having taken her in,
though, as she told herself, she really
did not know what else could she have
done.</p>

<p>A few days after the Brent goose was
sent to the Pells, Fairy, on coming back
from the Rectory at four o’clock, found
she had left one of her books behind her,
and as Charlie was not to be found,
being in all probability at the Pells,
paying an afternoon visit on his goose,
Fairy with some difficulty persuaded
Mrs. Shelley to let her go back to the
Rectory alone, declaring she would be
home again before dark.</p>

<p>She reached the Rectory safely, got
her book, and was just passing the
Winter-bourne, about ten minutes’ walk
from the shepherd’s house, when, rather
to her annoyance, Dame Hursey suddenly
appeared from a by-lane and
stopped her.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mrs. Hursey; I must
not stop, it is getting so dark; mother
will be frightened,” said Fairy, trying to
pass the old woman, mindful of her
promise to Jack, and secretly rather
nervous at her encounter with the old
wool-gatherer in this lonely spot, and in
the gathering gloom of a November
evening.</p>

<p>“Mother, indeed! You have a grander
lady for your mother than Mrs. Shelley
ever saw the like of, proud as she and
her son Jack may be, I am thinking;
but never mind that—one of these fine
days Dame Hursey may tell you some
news that will open those pretty eyes of
yours, till they will look bigger than ever.
Tell me, child, you can read writing, of
course, can’t you?” said Dame Hursey,
pulling aside her coarse apron, and
fumbling among the folds of her tattered
linsey skirt for her pocket.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can read and write too; but I
really must be going home; it is getting
so late,” said Fairy.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, child; I am not
going to keep you long. I want you to
read a letter for me I had from my son
this morning; maybe there is something
in it I should not care for just everyone to
know; I have been on the look out for
John Shelley or gentleman Jack all day,
but I have missed them somehow, and I
can’t read writing myself. Ah! here it
is at last,” producing a letter from the
bottom of a very capacious pocket filled
with some very incongruous articles—a
few coppers, a piece of cheese, a thimble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">{116}</span>
a sock she was knitting, some corks,
and various other odds and ends too
numerous to mention.</p>

<p>Fairy took the letter, and by Dame
Hursey’s instructions read it aloud. It
ran as follows:—</p>

<p>“Dear Mother,</p>

<p>“I am just home from Australia,
but I am going back there again at
once. First, I want to see you, as I
think you can tell me something I want
to know, so will you meet me on the top
of Mount Harry at three o’clock next
Saturday afternoon? I shall be there,
and, if you are living, I shall expect
you. Till then I am your affectionate
son,</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">George</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p>“Is that all? Every word of it?”
asked Dame Hursey, fixing her black
eyes on the child.</p>

<p>“Yes. Shall I read it again?” said
Fairy.</p>

<p>“No. Next Saturday afternoon at
three o’clock, on the top of Mount
Harry. I shall be there safe enough.
Thank you, my pretty one; I shan’t forget
that one good turn deserves another.
Good-night,” and the old wool-gatherer
dived into a lane, and was out of sight
before Fairy had recovered her astonishment,
when she took to her heels and
fled breathless to Mrs. Shelley, who
was anxiously watching at the gate for
her.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Novello, Ewer, and Co.</span></h3>

<p><i>Beethoven’s Songs.</i> Vol. I. With both the
German words and an English version. By
the Rev. Dr. Troutbeck, to whom we are
indebted for so many excellent translations of
words to music.—This truly valuable collection,
including such specimens as “Adelaide,” “The
Glory of God in Nature,” popularly known as
“Creation’s Hymn,” will be eagerly sought
for by all singers; particularly when we
mention that the twenty-six songs may be
purchased for eighteenpence.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp48" id="i_page_116" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/page_116.jpg" alt="Musica" />
</div>

<p><i>Liederkreis.</i> The opus 39. By Schumann.—A
circle of twelve songs, many well known to
you. Amongst them we find the “Frühlingsnacht,”
“Mondnacht,” “In der Fremde,”
and other lovely poems.</p>

<p><i>Six Duets.</i> For soprano and contralto.
By F. H. Cowen.—Form a most charming
volume, and are published at the same
moderate price and in the same excellent
form, with clear type and careful editing.</p>

<p><i>Six Vocal Duets</i>, for the same voices.
By Oliver King, a rising composer, may also
be warmly recommended.</p>

<p><i>Ten Songs.</i> By George J. Bennett, a
youthful Academy student. Settings of words
by Robert Burns. Are all most fresh and
delightful, and add to a reputation which this
hard-working young composer has already
firmly established.</p>

<p><i>Three volumes of Piano pieces</i>, by Fritz
Spindler, a well-known pianoforte teacher
and composer in Dresden (forming numbers of
Novello’s Pianoforte Albums), are most useful
and artistic contributions to our store of light
piano music. The transcriptions of subjects
by Wagner are very good.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Forsyth Brothers.</span></h3>

<p><i>Scales and Arpeggios.</i> By Harvey Löhr.—These
excellent studies are systematically
fingered, and contain many useful hints
towards improving the pianist’s technique.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Joseph Williams.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Star of our Love.</i> By F. H. Cowen.—A
graceful, well-written song, to words by the
late Hugh Conway, whose little books have
created so much excitement lately. Compass
D to E or F to G.</p>

<p><i>Clouds</i>, and <i>I love you too well</i>. Two more
songs by the same eminent composer. Published
in one or two keys.</p>

<p><i>Three Songs.</i> Words and music by W. A.
Aikin.—Very simple and effective.</p>

<p><i>The Ride of Fortune</i> (founded on Shakespeare’s
lines, “There is a tide in the affairs of
men,” &amp;c.). By Charles A. Trew.—An
excellent contralto song.</p>

<p><i>Operatic Fantasias.</i> For violin, with
piano accompaniment. By F. Davidson
Palmer Mus.Bac.—Judging from <i>Il Trovatore</i>,
the number before us, these fantasias should
be often used for concerts and other entertainments,
where a faithful transcription of
operatic melodies is required, untrammelled by
too many cadenzas and fireworks for the solo
instrument.</p>

<p><i>La Figlia del Reggimento.</i>—This selection
is also to be commended. It is for two
violins and piano, and arranged by John
Barnard.</p>

<p><i>Sarabande</i> (ancien style). Pour piano. Par
Henri Roubier. <i>Idée Dansante.</i> For piano.
By Percy Reeve.—Two dances above the
average, graceful and musicianly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">{117}</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">William Czerny.</span></h3>

<p><i>Partita</i>, in D minor. For violin and piano.
By Hubert Parry.—A scholarly work, made
up of six sections:—Maestoso, Allemande,
Presto, Sarabande, two Bourrées, and a
Passepied in Rondo form. One might almost
call it a Sonatina of many movements. The
partita differs from the suite in not being
restricted to dances only.</p>

<p><i>Je l’aimerai toujours.</i> An easy piano piece
for beginners. Composed by François Behr.</p>

<p><i>Intermezzo-Minuet.</i> A short entr’acte for
piano. By G. Bachmann.—This smoothly-written
morceau is included in Czerny’s
orchestral series as a string quartett.</p>

<p><i>Adoration.</i> A meditation upon Bach’s 7th
“Small Prelude.” By Oscar Wagner.—Arranged
for piano and violin, or flute or violoncello,
with organ and additional strings,
upon the model of Gounod’s similar work, but
scarcely so interesting, and certainly not so
spontaneous in melodic treatment. It is also
arranged as an “O Salutaris Hostia” for
voice, violin, piano, and organ or harmonium.</p>

<p><i>Stars of the Summer Night.</i> By Edouard
Lassen.</p>

<p><i>My All-in-all.</i> By Theodor Bradsky.—Both
these songs have violin obbligatos, in
which the chief fault appears to be that the
violin never rests, not even for a bar.</p>

<p><i>Happy Days.</i> A touching song. By poor
Max Schröter. Compass C to F.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Phillips and Page.</span></h3>

<p><i>For ever with the Lord!</i> Sacred song.
By Gounod.—A new song by Gounod needs
only to be mentioned to engage the attention
of our readers. Gounod has been happier in
his setting of other English hymns, such as
the “Green hill far away” and the “King
of Love my Shepherd is.” But there are some
lovely points in this. It is published in keys
suitable to all voices, both as a solo and a
duet, and it also appears in anthem form for
four voices and organ.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">J. and J. Hopkinson.</span></h3>

<p><i>She Noddit to Me.</i> A song that bids fair
to become most popular. The words by A.
Dewar Willock.—Describe the delight of a
Scotch body at receiving a “special bow”
from the Queen as she passed her cottage on
the Deeside. The music is by J. Hoffmann,
and it is dedicated by special permission to
Her Majesty.</p>

<p><i>The Crusader.</i> A stirring baritone song.
By Theo. Bonheur.</p>

<p><i>The Goblin.</i> A cynical poem, set to music
by Gustav Ernest, whose clever works we have
before noticed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">E. Ascherberg and Co.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Winged Chorister.</i> The music by
Pinsuti.—The chorister in question (although
there is a harmonium part) is not a dying choir
boy, but a robin which has got into the church
by some means, and whose “pure, clear notes,”
it is suggested, “would harmonise our coarser
tones, and bear them straight to Heaven.”
Our recollection of the robin’s note, easily
imitated by tapping two pennies together,
hardly carries out this lofty idea!</p>

<p><i>Let us Wander by the Sea</i>, and <i>The Merry
Summer Time</i>. Two duets for soprano and
contralto. By our much lamented countryman,
Henry Smart, whose delicate fancy has in
so many ways enriched English music.—The
edition before us is ruined, as far as outward
appearance goes, by vulgar drawings on the
covers.</p>

<p><i>Aubade Française.</i> A most elegant serenade
in the purely French style. By M. de Nevers.—Very
suitable for a light tenor voice.</p>

<p><i>Gavotte des Oiseaux.</i> A bright little dance
for pianoforte. By G. Bachmann.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">F. Pitman.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Musical Monthly.</i>—This last year’s
number is as extraordinary a shillingsworth
as ever, containing, in the midst of much that
is unworthy, several good old English airs,
some of Mendelssohn’s songs without words,
five songs from the <i>Bohemian Girl</i>, of Balfe’s,
some good Scotch songs, etc., etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have also received an advance copy of
No. 1 of the “Violin Soloist,” well got up,
and containing ten or twelve good solos. It
is to be brought out monthly at a penny per
number.</p>

<p><i>Canadian March.</i> For Piano. Solo and
duet, and for every other imaginable combination.
Composed by Carl Litolff.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">North of England School Furnishing
Company.</span></h3>

<p><i>150 Exercises and Questions in the Elements
of Music.</i> By I. L. Jopling, L.R.A.M.—Most
thorough and searching test questions,
systematically and exhaustively treated. This
little book will prove of great help in preparing
for the elementary examinations of the
various colleges and academies. It is to be
used after studying Mr. Davenport’s primer.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The London Music Publishing Company.</span></h3>

<p>Six songs by Erskine Allon to words by
Sir Thomas Wyatt, who died in 1542.—All
that Mr. Allon writes is interesting. In these
songs the accompaniments are as full of charm
as the melodies are of quaint character and
grace.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">C. King.</span></h3>

<p>Shakesperian Sketches, for Pianoforte, by
Frank Adlam.—Clever illustrations of passages
and scenes in Shakespeare’s plays.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Boosey and Co.</span></h3>

<p><i>The Choralist</i>: 269, “Waiting for the
Spring.” 270, “A Winter Serenade.”—Two
capital four-part songs by J. S. Mitchell.—267,
“Come, Lassies and Lads.”—A masterly
arrangement in four parts of the good old
seventeenth-century ditty.</p>

<p><i>Cavendish Music Books.</i>—In No. 101
we have a selection of American pieces. To
those who wish to know what our cousins on
the other side of the Atlantic are doing in
musical composition, we advise a perusal of
this selection. It proves that, at any rate in
this kind of art work, we are more “go-ahead”
than they are.</p>

<p><i>The Sweet old River.</i> Song by Sydney
Smith.—A smoothly written song, published
in C and E flat.</p>

<p><i>Dreams.</i> Song by Cecile S. Hartog.—Miss
Hartog’s compositions are exceptionally good,
and far above the average ballad.</p>

<p><i>The Wide, Wide Sea.</i>—One of the best
songs that Stephen Adams has written. Compass,
B flat to E flat, or C to F.</p>

<p><i>In the Chimney Corner.</i> By F. H. Cowen.—A
song of the Behrend type, but higher in
conception, and rather more hopeful in tone.</p>

<p><i>Go, Pretty Rose.</i> Duet in canon. By
Marzials.—We recommend this duet to all
who have sung and admired his other canon,
“My true love hath my heart.” It is a most
elegant canon, and very melodious and bright
withal.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stanley Lucas and Co.</span></h3>

<p><i>Grave and Corno.</i> By Joseph Gibbs (1744),
and air and jigg by Richard Jones (17th
century). All for violin and piano.—These
really good and interesting relics of old
English composition have been revived by
Herr Peiniger, who has arranged a piano part
from the figured basses. Just as we admire
the case of an organ, so may we speak of the
admirable covers to these pieces. They are in
excellent taste.</p>

<p><i>Five Pictures on a Journey.</i> By F. W.
Davenport.—Well written and suggestive piano
pieces.</p>

<p><i>Episodes for the Piano.</i> By Frederick
Westlake.—We have received No. 1, Prelude,
and feel sure that the others equally well sustain
the reputation of this esteemed professor
of the Royal Academy.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">e</span> come now to speak
about the receiving
and the paying
away of money.
These are things
which, by common
consent, are always
done in a certain
way. If they are
done otherwise it
shows either a want
of sense or a want of education.</p>

<p>When money owing to any person is paid, a
receipt for it should always be given—that is to
say, it should be acknowledged in writing that
the money has changed hands. If the receiver
merely takes it and puts it in her pocket, she
who pays will have no security, except the
receiver’s good faith and good memory, against
being called on to pay the sum a second time.</p>

<p>A receipt may be given in any form of
words, but the following are correct forms for
business purposes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right p2"><i><span class="smcap">London</span>, 15th September, 1886.</i></p>
<p>
£17 4s. 6d.
</p>

<p><i>Received from Miss Rose Hastaway,
Chester, the sum of seventeen pounds four
shillings and sixpence in payment of account
rendered (or of annexed account.)</i></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Flora Malcolm.</span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right p2">
<i><span class="smcap">Guildford</span>, 12th July, 1886.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Received from Mrs. Trundle the sum of
six pounds seven shillings and ninepence, in
payment of account to this date.</i></p>

<p>
£6 7s. 9d.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Badger.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>On all receipts for money amounting to
£2 or upwards you must put a penny stamp.
Not long ago there was a stamp sold
expressly for the purpose, but now a penny
postage stamp is used, which is much simpler.
The stamp may be placed anywhere, but is
best where the signature is, the signature
being written across it. If the receipt of
money is acknowledged in a letter, the stamp
should be put at the end, just where you sign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">{118}</span>
your name. It is always better, however, to
give a separate and formal receipt.</p>

<p>The Government require that either the
name or the initials of the person giving the
receipt be put on the stamp, <i>together with the
true date of writing</i>, the object being to show
clearly and distinctly that the stamp has been
used. Ordinarily the date is given in a contracted
form, for instance, the two receipts
given above would have “15. ix. 86” under
the name of Flora Malcolm, and “12. vii. 86”
under that of Elizabeth Badger. Figures
representing the amount for which the receipt
is given are often added also.</p>

<p>Whoever gives the receipt pays for the
stamp, and the penalty for refusing to give a
duly stamped receipt in any case where the
receipt is liable to duty is £10.</p>

<p>When you receive money as a loan, you may
acknowledge it by what is called an I O U,
which is in this form:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p2 right">
<i><span class="smcap">Carlisle</span>, 3rd October, 1886.</i></p>
<p><i>To Miss Alice Golightly</i>,<br />
<span class="ml2">I O U <i>three pounds ten shillings</i>.</span></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Anne Winkle.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>I O U’s are not much in favour in business;
they are rather friendly documents than business
ones.</p>

<p>An I O U does not need a stamp, whatever
the amount may be, as it is simply an acknowledgment
of a debt, and neither a receipt nor
a promissory note—that is, a note giving a
promise to pay at a particular time. Suppose
Miss Winkle had written, “<i>I O U Three
pounds ten shillings to be paid on the 2nd of
January, 1887</i>,” she would have changed her
I O U into a promissory note, which would
have required a stamp.</p>

<p>But “neither a borrower nor a lender be”—which
is another way of saying that I O U’s
are to be avoided. When the money is repaid,
the I O U, of course, is returned to the
person who gave it.</p>

<p>In cases where money is received in payment
of an account, and the acknowledgment is
put on the account itself, the account is “discharged,”
as it is called, in any one of the
following ways. The person to whom the
account is due writes on it her own name,
and, preceding her name, the words, “<i>Paid</i>,”
“<i>Received Payment</i>,” “<i>Received</i>,” or “<i>Discharged</i>,”
or—if such be the case—“<i>Same
time paid</i>,” or “<i>Paid by cheque</i>.”</p>

<p>Or this form may be used. Suppose the
amount to be £25 10s. and the discount five
per cent.</p>

<p>Should you be receiving payment for somebody
else, you sign as you would a letter in
similar circumstances. Thus:—</p>

<p>
<i><span class="ml2">Same time paid,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">for <span class="smcap">Margaret Bell</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="ml6"><span class="smcap">Ellen Chapman</span>.</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>or,</p>

<p>
<i><span class="ml2">Paid by cheque,</span><br />
<span class="ml4"><span class="smcap">Mary G. Grove</span>,</span><br />
<span class="ml6">per <span class="smcap">Ina Meadows</span>.</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>Some polite people, in discharging accounts
write “<i>with thanks</i>” in the left-hand bottom
corner or under their signature. In the case
of tradespeople, it is a courteous phrase that
sometimes goes a long way towards securing
another order.</p>

<p>Receipts of all kinds should be kept for at
least six years. After that time you may
either continue to keep them or make a bonfire
of them. The reason for your being then
free to please yourself is that actions for unclaimed
debt arising out of a simple contract
are limited to six years <i>from the date of the
cause of action</i>. After six years you are safe
against being called on to pay the money a
second time.</p>

<p>Bills are occasionally rendered a second time
after being paid, not the least, perhaps, from
an intention to defraud, but simply from carelessness.
People omit to enter the money
they receive in their books, and forget they
have got it; and to keep all receipts is a way
of protecting oneself against such a happy-go-lucky
style of doing things.</p>

<p>Receipts should be folded in the same way
as letters, and marked on the outside with all
necessary particulars. Thus:—</p>

<p class="center">
<i>12th August, 1886.<br />
Griffin and Constable,<br />
Manchester.<br />
Washing Machine</i><br />
£3 15s.<br />
</p>

<p>If you have a set of pigeon-holes, receipts
should have a pigeon-hole all to themselves;
if not, keep them tied up in a bundle and
arranged in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>When you have to make out accounts always
do it as neatly as possible. A neat account
has a well-to-do air, and may do as much good
to one’s credit sometimes as a handsome
balance at the bank. Hard-up people are
seldom neat either in accounts, or correspondence,
or anything else.</p>

<p>Accounts or invoices in business are usually
made out on ruled and printed forms, and are
headed with the address of the seller. After
that come the names of the buyer and seller,
thus:—</p>

<p>
<i><span class="ml2"><span class="smcap">Miss Rachel O’Flinn</span>,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">Bought of <span class="smcap">Leigh, Goldhawk, and Still</span>.</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>Or the wording may be,</p>

<p>
<i><span class="ml2"><span class="smcap">Miss Rachel O’Flinn</span>,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">To <span class="smcap">Leigh, Goldhawk, and Still</span></span></i>,<br />
</p>

<p>which mean that Miss Rachel O’Flinn is
<i>debtor to</i> the firm named, the word “debtor”
being dropped in practice.</p>

<p>Below the names of the parties the terms of
sale are sometimes put: “<i>Nett Cash</i>” or
“<i>Cash in 14 days</i>,” or “<i>Accounts rendered
monthly</i>,” or whatever the conditions are.
Then follow the particulars of the goods sold,
the dates when they passed into the hands of
the purchaser being put in the left hand
margin.</p>

<p>People who have any money transactions at
all, and do not wish their affairs to get into
hopeless confusion, must keep books of some
sort—that is to say, they must adopt a plan
of writing down their transactions in regular
order for easy reference.</p>

<p>It may be a primitive method or a very
elaborate one—that depends on the nature and
requirements of the business—but some system
there must be, and of book-keeping in at least
its general principles every business woman
should make a study. By its means we gain
an exact knowledge of how we stand, we see
what comes in and what goes out, how much
we owe and how much other people owe us,
and whether we are putting any of our money
into bags with holes.</p>

<p>There are many good books published on
the subject of book-keeping, and by all means
study the best treatise you can get; but better
than all books is actual practice. The experience
of keeping an account of one’s own transactions
for a week gives more insight than all
the books that have ever been written. In a
book, things seem sometimes exceedingly puzzling,
whilst in reality they are simple enough.</p>

<p>The main fact to be grasped in book-keeping
is the distinction between debtor and
creditor; you must get it well into your head
that <i>the person or thing represented by an
account is “debtor to” what he, she, or it
receives, and “creditor by” whatever he, she,
or it gives or parts with</i>.</p>

<p>The simpler business books are the better,
so long as they answer the purpose for which
they are intended. They must be clear to the
person who keeps them, and clear also to any
who have to consult them. The utmost care
should be taken with them, so as to have no
blotting, no scraping out of figures, and no
tearing out of leaves.</p>

<p>There are two ways of keeping books,
known as single entry and double entry.
Single entry is called so because each item is
entered only once in the accounts of the
ledger, which is the principal book. In
double entry, on the other hand, it is entered
twice, to the debtor side of one account and
to the credit of some other account.</p>

<p>In this way, when books on the double
entry system have all the sums on the debtor
side and all the sums on the creditor side added
up, the total amounts in both cases are the
same. That is, if the books have been rightly kept
and no mistake has been made in addition,
like that of the man who spent a long time
trying to make them come right, and found
at last he had made the slight mistake on one
of the sides of adding in the figures of the
current year.</p>

<p>The object of double entry is to establish a
series of checks so that mistakes are not likely
to occur, and in all establishments of any
importance this is the system adopted.
Books kept by the other and simpler system
of single entry afford no check upon themselves.
“Errors in addition,” says Mr. A. L.
Lewis, “which are as easy to make in
hundreds of pounds as in pence, errors and
omissions in posting or in carrying forward
balances, any or all of which may entail
serious loss, can only be prevented in single
entry books by the most careful checking and
rechecking every item, and no one, however
sharpsighted, can always avoid making an
error, and even failing to discover it when
made.”</p>

<p>What is called <i>posting</i> in book-keeping is
the operation of transferring items from one
book to another, and arranging them there
under their proper heads. The difference between
the Dr. and Cr. sides of an account is
known as the <i>balance</i>.</p>

<p>Transactions are entered in their books by
business people at once. They never put off
making an entry till to-morrow, for they are
well aware that there is no putting any dependence
on memory.</p>

<p>They are constantly turning over their
books, too, so as to keep their affairs fresh in
their minds, and see in a general way how
they are getting on. Then every little while
they go particularly into all their accounts and
strike a balance as it is called—that is to say,
make out a statement of their assets and
liabilities, and arrange things for a fresh start.
The word assets, we may as well mention,
stands for property or sums of money owing to
anyone, and liabilities means just the reverse.</p>

<p>There are two mistakes often made in
balancing books which a business woman
must take care never to fall into. The first is
to include bad debts—debts of which you are
never likely to get a farthing, or, at best
only a few shillings in the pound—on the
same footing as if they were good ones. The
second is to calculate that property we possess
is worth what we paid for it, never considering
that as a general rule things decrease in value
every year through use and change of fashion
and other causes. The only wise plan is to
subtract from the first cost, every time we
balance, a certain sum to represent what is
termed <i>depreciation of property</i>. All such
deductions should be made with a liberal
hand; no harm is done by estimating ourselves
poorer than we really are, but many a one has
been ruined by mistaken calculations, showing
property to be worth a good deal more than it
would fetch in the market.</p>

<p>When one person acts for another in money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">{119}</span>
matters, a statement, called an account
current, should be sent at regular intervals—say
once a half year or once every twelve
months—showing the transactions. Here is
an example. For convenience in printing we
shall place the Cr. side below the Dr.; but in
practice the two sides should be placed alongside
of each other—the Dr. side to the left,
and the Cr. side to the right.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Errors Excepted.</i></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nathaniel Evans.</span></p>
<p><i><span class="smcap">London</span>, December 31st, 1885.</i></p></div>

<p>Here on the Cr. side we have all the sums
received by Nathaniel Evans for Miss Winifred
Holt, and on the Dr. side all the payments
made to her or for her by him. Instead
of “<i>Errors Excepted</i>,” before the signature,
“<i>E. E.</i>” might have been written, or
“<i>E. &amp; O.E.</i>,” which last means “<i>Errors and
Omissions Excepted</i>.” These guarded phrases,
however, may be omitted. You may correct
errors afterwards, whether they are there or
not. If accounts of this kind, or, indeed, any
accounts, are thought to be incorrect, the fact
should be intimated to the persons sending
them <i>at once</i>.</p>

<p>Book-keeping and the making out of accounts
requires ability in calculation. Indeed,
no one can succeed in getting a character for
business capacity who has not all the rules of
arithmetic at her fingers’ ends. The use of
“Ready Reckoners,” “Interest Tables,” or
such-like compilations, often saves, however,
a great deal of trouble, even when people are
quick at figures. Some pretend they can do
without such helps, but they would be better
to use them. We ought to avail ourselves of
all the help we can get, and it is absurd to
take roundabout ways of doing things when
short cuts will answer the same purpose.</p>

<p>Besides understanding about the right
method of keeping books and making out accounts,
the thorough business woman will know
well about the art of buying. Here we see
how a knowledge of business ways may assist
in the upbuilding of happy homes. One who
understands the art of buying will return
triumphant from marketing expeditions, and
when she goes shopping there will be no fear
of her wasting the contents of the family
purse.</p>

<p>The good buyer does not spend much time
in going her rounds. She has made herself
familiar beforehand with the qualities of things,
the methods by which they are adulterated,
and the seasons when they are cheapest, and
if the goods shown her are not what she wants,
she says so, and no persuasive tongue can
induce her to take them. “Much comment
on the part of the seller,” says an American
writer, “she regards as an incentive to be
wary; and all pretences to confidential favours,
unless proved to be such by undoubted documentary
evidence, as a reproach to her understanding.”</p>

<p>She makes it a rule to deal with respectable
people only, knowing that by that course she
is best served, and you never find her very
sharp-set on bargains. She knows better.</p>

<p>On the subject of bargains Mr. Charles
Dickens, in his “Dictionary of London,” has
some wise remarks. They specially refer to
the metropolis, but they are applicable to all
large towns over the country. Everywhere
skilfully-baited traps are set for the unwary,
though it is in London that the traps catch
most victims and rogues reap the best harvest.</p>

<p>Bargains, Mr. Dickens points out, are to be
met with, of course, but only by those who know
very well what they are about. The numerous
“bankrupts’ stocks,” “tremendous sacrifices,”
and so forth, are just so many hooks on which
to catch simpletons.</p>

<p>“One of the commonest tricks of all is that
of putting in the window, say, a handsome
mantle, worth eight or ten guineas, and labelled,
say, £3 15s., and keeping inside for sale others
made up in precisely the same style, but of
utterly worthless material. If they decline to
sell you the actual thing out of the window,
be sure that the whole affair is a swindle. See,
too, that in taking it from the window they
do not drop it behind the counter and substitute
one of the others—an ingenious little bit
of juggling not very difficult of performance.</p>

<p>“Another very taking device is the attaching
to each article a price label in black ink,
elaborately altered in red to one twenty or
five and twenty per cent. less. This has a very
ingenuous air. But when the price has been—as
it commonly has—raised thirty or forty
per cent. before the first black ink marking,
the economy is not large.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you do buy anything out of
one of these shops, you will take it with you.
If you have it sent, be particularly careful not
to pay for it until it arrives, and not then till
you have thoroughly examined it.</p>

<p>“When a shop of this kind sends you
‘patterns,’ you will usually find a request attached
not to cut them. Always carefully
disregard this, keeping a small piece for comparison.</p>

<p>“There are, however, some houses where, if
you at all understand your business, real bargains
are at times to be had.”</p>

<p>The business woman is not often to be seen
at auctions either, and if ever she does go, she
makes sure beforehand that the sale is to be
conducted on strictly honourable principles,
and presided over by an auctioneer who is
above suspicion. She is well aware that there
are many unscrupulous individuals who, under
cover of an auctioneer’s licence, lend themselves
to transactions the reverse of honest.</p>

<p>For example, in company with a band of
“followers,” as they are called—back-street
brokers and “general dealers” of shady character—auctioneers
of this sort take a dwelling-house,
and cram it with worthless furniture.
Then, after a month or two, the whole is
seized under a fictitious “bill of sale,” to give
the affair an appearance of genuineness, and
the trashy goods are disposed of by auction
to the unsuspicious public, the rogues dividing
the spoil.</p>

<p>Another plan is to get possession of a shop
in a frequented thoroughfare, and, day after
day, beguile innocent folk to enter the premises,
and then wheedle and bully them into bidding
for and buying a lot of rubbish at four or five
times more than its actual worth. It is quite
a mistake to suppose that goods disposed of
“under the hammer,” as it is termed, must
necessarily sell for less than their real worth.</p>

<p>These mock auctions are swindles pure and
simple, and what the initiated call “rigged
sales” are not much better. These take place
at auction rooms of more or less legitimate
position, are usually held in the evening, and
consist chiefly of articles vamped up or made
expressly for the purpose. No one should go
to them who wants to get value for her money.</p>

<p>In all dealings with tradespeople, a good
business woman will do her best to pay cash.
As she does this, she always goes to ready-money
shops. Shops that give credit must
charge higher prices, for they must have interest
for the money out of which they lie; and,
besides, they must add to the price of their
articles to cover the risk that some of their
customers will not pay. Those who do pay,
pay not only for the credit they get themselves,
but for the failure of others.</p>

<p>Now and again, however, to postpone paying
one’s debts has an advantage, as was the
case with a merchant whom Southey, the
poet, once met at Lisbon. “I never pay a
porter,” said this merchant, “for bringing a
burden till the next day; for while the fellow
feels his back ache with the weight he charges
high; but when he comes the next day, the feeling
is gone, and he asks only half the money.”
But it is not often that one has the chance of
getting a reduction in this way.</p>

<p>The cash buyer has many advantages, not
the least being an easy mind and a knowledge
at all times of what she is worth. Let every
girl, then, keep in mind for the rest of her
days the remark of the American writer, who
said, “I have discovered the philosopher’s
stone. It consists of four short words of
homely English—‘Pay as you go.’” The
easiness of credit has been the ruin of many
people, by inducing them to buy what they
could not hope, unless by a miracle, ever to
pay for.</p>

<p>So much for the business woman in her
dealings in a private capacity with business
people. In a business capacity, however, one
must sometimes both give and receive credit.
But, it cannot be said with too strong an emphasis,
the less of it the better.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Composer and the Sea-Captain.</span></p>

<p>When Haydn, the composer, was in
London, he had several whimsical adventures,
and the following is one of them:—A captain
in the Navy came to him one morning, and
asked him to compose a march for some
troops he had on board, offering him thirty
guineas for his trouble, but requiring it to be
done immediately, as the vessel was to sail
next day for Calcutta.</p>

<p>As soon as the captain had gone, Haydn
sat down to the pianoforte, and the march
was ready in a few minutes. Feeling some
scruples, however, at gaining his money so
very easily, Haydn wrote two other marches,
intending first to give the captain his choice,
and then to make him a present of all the
three, as a return for his liberality.</p>

<p>Next morning the captain came and asked
for his march.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said the composer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">{120}</span></p>

<p>The captain asked to hear it on the pianoforte;
and having done so, laid down the
thirty guineas, pocketed the march, and walked
away.</p>

<p>Haydn tried to stop him, but in vain—the
march was very good.</p>

<p>“But I have written two others,” cried
Haydn, “which are better—hear them and
take your choice.”</p>

<p>“I like the first very well, and that is
enough,” answered the captain, pursuing his
way downstairs.</p>

<p>Haydn followed, crying out, “But I make
you a present of them.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have them,” roared the seaman,
and bolted out at the street door.</p>

<p>Haydn, determined not to be outdone,
hastened to the Exchange, and, discovering
the name of the ship and her commander,
sent the marches on board, with a polite note,
which the captain, surmising its contents, sent
back unopened.</p>

<p>The composer tore the marches into a
thousand pieces, and never forgot this liberal
English humourist as long as he lived.</p>

<p>Some people, not to be copied, live in a
perpetual state of fret. The weather is always
objectionable; the temperature is never satisfactory.
They have too much to do, and are
driven to death, or too little, and have no
resources. If they are ill they know they
shall never get well; if they are well they
expect soon to be ill. Their daily work is
either drudgery, which they hate, or so difficult
and complex that they cannot execute it.</p>

<p>In contrast to these, we meet sometimes
with men and women so bright and cheery
that their very presence is a positive pleasure.
They discover the favourable side of the
weather, of their business, of home surroundings,
of social relations, even of political
affairs. They will tell you of all the pleasant
things that happen and give voice to all the
joy they feel. Of course, they are sometimes
annoyed and worried by petty troubles, but
the very effort they make to pass them over
silently diminishes their unpleasant effect
upon themselves and prevents the influence
from extending.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Good-tempered Wife.</span></p>

<p>A man in Sussex whose wife was blessed
with a remarkably even temper went over the
way to a neighbour one evening and said—</p>

<p>“Neighbour, I just should like to see my
wife cross for once. I’ve tried all I know, and
I can’t make her cross no way.”</p>

<p>“You can’t make your wife cross?” said
his neighbour. “I wish I could make mine
anything else. But you just do what I tell
you, and if that won’t act nothing will. You
bring her in some night a lot of the crookedest
bats you can get, them as won’t lie in no
form, and see how she makes out then.”</p>

<p>The bats (or pieces of wood) were accordingly
brought in, as awkward and crooked and
contrary as could be found. The man went
away early to work, and at noon returned to
see the result of his experiment. He was
greeted with a smiling face and the gentle
request—</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="ph3">THE FASHION OF THIS WORLD.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase"> have</span> said that
from the first moment
I had felt a
singular attraction
towards my new
mistress. As the
days went on, and
I became better
acquainted with
the rare beauty
and unselfishness of
her nature, my respect
and affection deepened.
I soon grew to
love Mrs. Morton as
I have loved few people
in this life.</p>

<p>My service became
literally a service
of love; it was with no sense of humiliation
that I owned myself her servant;
obedience to so gentle a rule was simply
a delight. I anticipated her wishes
before they were expressed, and an ever-deepening
sense of the sacredness and
dignity of my charge made me impervious
to small slights and moved me to
fresh efforts.</p>

<p>I was no longer tormented by my old
feelings of uselessness and inefficiency.
The despondent fears of my girlhood (and
girlhood is often troubled by these unwholesome
fancies), that there was no
special work for me in the human vineyard,
had ceased to trouble me. I was
a bread winner, and my food tasted all
the sweeter for that thought. I was
preaching silently day by day my new
crusade. Every morning I woke cheerfully
to the simple routine of the day’s
duties. Every night I lay down between
my children’s cots with a satisfied conscience,
and a mind at rest, while the
soft breathings of the little creatures
beside me seemed to lull me to sleep.</p>

<p>It was a strangely quiet life for a girl
of two-and-twenty, but I soon grew
used to it. When I felt dull I read; at
other times I sang over my work, out of
pure lightheartedness, and I could hear
Joyce’s shrill little treble joining in from
her distant corner.</p>

<p>“I wish I could sing like you, Merle,”
Mrs. Morton once said to me, when she
had interrupted our duet; “your voice
is very sweet and true, and deserves to
be cultivated. Since my baby’s death
my voice has wholly left me.”</p>

<p>“It will come back with time and
rest,” I returned, reassuringly, but she
shook her head.</p>

<p>“Rest; that is a word I hardly know.
When I was a girl I never knew life
would be such a fatiguing thing. There
are too many duties for the hours; one
tries to fit them in properly, but when
night comes the sense of failure haunts
one’s dreams.”</p>

<p>“That is surely a symptom of overwork,”
was my remark in answer to this.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, but under
the circumstances it cannot be helped.
If only I could be more with my darlings,
and enjoy their pretty ways; but at least
it is a comfort to me to know they have
so faithful a nurse in my absence.”</p>

<p>She was always making these little
speeches to me; it was one of her gracious
ways. She could be grateful to a
servant for doing her duty. She was
not one of those people who take everything
as a matter of course, who treat
their domestics and hirelings as though
they were mere machines for the day’s
work; on the contrary, she recognised
their humanity; she would sympathise
as tenderly with a sick footman or a
kitchen-maid in trouble as she would
with any of her richer neighbours. It
was this large-mindedness and beneficence
that made her household worship
her. When I learnt more about her
former life, I marvelled at her grand
self-abnegation. I grew to understand
that from the day of her marriage she
had simply effaced herself for her husband’s
sake; her tastes, her favourite
pursuits, had all been resigned without
a murmur that she might lead his life.</p>

<p>She had been a simple country girl
when he married her; her bees, her
horse, and her father’s dogs had been
her great interests; to ride with her
father over his farms had been her chief
delight. She had often risen with the
lark, and was budding her roses amid
the dews.</p>

<p>When the young rising politician,
Alick Morton, had first met her at a
neighbouring squire’s house, her sweet
bloom and unconscious beauty won him
in spite of himself, and from the first
hour of their meeting he vowed to himself
that Violet Cheriton should be his
wife.</p>

<p>No greater change had ever come to
a woman. In spite of her great love,
there must have been times when Violet
Morton looked back on her innocent and
happy girlhood with something like regret,
if ever a true-hearted wife and
mother permits herself to indulge in
such a feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton was a devoted husband,
but he was an autocrat, and, in spite of
many fine qualities, was not without that
selfishness that leavens many a man’s
nature. He wanted his wife to himself;
his busy ambition aimed high; politics
was the breath of his life; unlike other
men in this, that he lived to work, instead
of working to live.</p>

<p>These sort of natures know no fatigue;
they are intolerant of difficulties; inaction
means death to them. Mr. Morton
was a committee man; he worked hard
for his party. He was a philanthropist
also, and took up warmly certain public
charities. His name was becoming
widely known; people spoke of him as
a rising man, who would be useful to his
generation. If he dragged his wife at
his triumphal chariot wheel, no one
blamed him; these sort of men need
real helpmeets. In these cases the
stronger nature rules: the weaker and
most loving submits.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton was a submissive wife;
early and late she toiled in her husband’s
service; their house was a rallying
point for his party. On certain
occasions the great drawing-rooms were
flung open to strangers; meetings were
held on behalf of the charities in which
Mr. Morton was interested; there were
speeches made, in which he largely distinguished
himself, while his wife hovered
on the outskirts of the crowd and listened
to him.</p>

<p>He kept no secretary, and his correspondence
was immense. Mrs. Morton
had a clear, characteristic handwriting,
and could write rapidly to dictation, and
many an hour was spent in her husband’s
study.</p>

<p>This was at first no weariness to her—she
loved to be beside him and share
his labours. What wife begrudges time
and work for her husband? But she
soon found that other labours supervened
that were less congenial to her.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton was overworked; the
demands on his time were unceasing.
Violet must visit the wards of his favourite
hospitals, and help him in keeping
the accounts. She must represent him
in society, and keep up constant intercourse
with the wives of the members
of their party during the season. She
worked harder even than he did. Her
bloom faded under the withering influence
of late hours and hot rooms.
Night after night she bore, with sweet
graciousness, the weary round of pleasures
that palled on her. It was a
martyrdom of human love, for, alas! in
the hurry of this unsatisfactory life, the
Divine voice had grown dim and far off
to the weary ear of Violet Morton; the
clanging metallic earth bells had deadened
the heavenly harmonies.</p>

<p>Sometimes a sad, pathetic look would
come into her eyes. Was she thinking,
I wonder, of the slim, bright-eyed girl
budding roses in the old-fashioned garden,
while the brown bees hummed round
her? Was the fragrance of the lilies—those
tall, white lilies of which she so
often spoke to me—blotting out the perfume
of hothouse flowers, and the heavy
scents of the crowded ball-room?</p>

<p>It was a matter of intense surprise
to me that Mr. Morton seemed perfectly
unconscious of this immense self-sacrifice.
He could not be ignorant, surely,
that a mother desires to be with her
children, and that a woman’s tender
frame is susceptible to fatigue. Selfish
as he was, he loved her too well to impose
such intolerable burthens on her
strength, if he had only known them to
be burthens. But her cheerfulness
blinded him. How could he know she
was overtasked, and often sad at heart,
when she never complained, when she
sealed her lips so generously?</p>

<p>If she had once said, “I am so tired,
Alick; I cannot write for you,” he
would at once have pressed her to rest;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">{127}</span>
but men are so dense, as Aunt Agatha
says. Their great minds overlook little
details. They take in wide vistas of
landscape, and never see the little
nettles that are choking up the field
path. Women would have noticed the
nettles at once, and spied out the gap
in the hedge beside.</p>

<p>I had not been many weeks in the
house before I found Sunday was no
day of rest to my employers, and yet
they were better than many other worldly
people. Mrs. Morton always went to
church in the morning, and, unless he
was too tired or busy, Mr. Morton went
too. They were careful, too, that their
servants should enjoy as far as possible
the privilege of the day. The carriage
was never used, so the horses and the
coachman were able to rest. They
dined an hour earlier, and invited only
one or two intimate friends to join them,
and there was always sacred music in
the evening. But there was no more
leisure for thought on that day than on
any other. In the afternoon Mr. Morton
wrote his letters and read his paper,
and Mrs. Morton had her share of correspondence;
the rest of the afternoon
was given to callers, or Mrs. Morton
accompanied her husband for a walk in
the park. She was always very careful
of her toilet on these occasions, and if
it were Travers’s Sunday out, my services
were in requisition. I had once
offered to assist her, and I suppose I had
given satisfaction. More than once Mr.
Morton had found fault with some part
of her dress, and she had gone back
to her dressing-room with the utmost
promptitude to change it.</p>

<p>“I have not satisfied my husband’s
taste, Merle,” she would say, as cheerfully
as possible; “will you help me to
do better?” And she would stand before
the glass with such a tired look on
her lovely face, as I brought her a fresh
mantle and bonnet.</p>

<p>I hate men to be over critical with
their wives, but I suppose it is a greater
compliment than not being able to see
if they are wearing their best or common
bonnet. I confess it must be trying to
a woman when a man says—and how
often he does say it?—“What a pretty
gown that is, my dear. Have I seen it
before?” when the aggravating creature
must know that she wore it all last summer,
and perhaps the previous summer
too.</p>

<p>I found out that Mrs. Morton was ill-satisfied
with the way they spent Sundays.</p>

<p>I remember one Sunday evening I was
sitting in the twilight with Reggie on
my lap and Joyce on her little stool beside
me. I had been teaching her a
new verse of her hymn, and she had
learned to say it very prettily. We
were both very busy over it, when the
door opened, and Mrs. Morton came
in.</p>

<p>Joyce jumped up and ran to her at
once.</p>

<p>“I know it, mother—my Sunday hymn—it
is such a pretty one.”</p>

<p>“Is it, my darling? Then, suppose
you let mother hear it.” And Joyce,
folding her hands in her quaint, old-fashioned
way, began very readily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love to hear the story</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which angel voices tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How once the King of Glory</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Came down on earth to dwell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am both weak and sinful,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But this I surely know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lord came down to save me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because He loved me so.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Very pretty indeed, Joyce,” observed
Mrs. Morton, rather absently,
when the child had finished. But Joyce
looked up in her face wistfully.</p>

<p>“Do you ever say hymns, mother
dear?”</p>

<p>“I sing them in church, my pet.”</p>

<p>“But you never teached them to me,
mother; they are all nurse’s hymns, the
little one and the long one, and the
little wee hymn I say with my prayers.
Would you like to hear my little wee
hymn, mother dear?”</p>

<p>“I will hear all you know, my darling.”
But there were tears in the
beautiful eyes as she listened.</p>

<p>“How nicely she says them! I am
glad you teach her such pretty hymns,
Merle,” as the child ran off to fetch
Snap, who was whining for admittance.
“Somehow it seems more like the Sunday
of old times up here—so quiet, so
peaceful. We must do as the world does,
I suppose; but these secular, bustling
Sundays are not to my taste.”</p>

<p>Her words jarred on me, and I replied
rather too quickly, considering my position,
“Are we obliged to follow a bad
fashion? That is indeed going with
the crowd to do evil.”</p>

<p>She looked up in some surprise. It
must have been a new thing to the
petted mistress of the household to hear
herself so sharply rebuked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” I exclaimed,
penitently; “I had no right to say that;
I forgot to whom I was speaking.”</p>

<p>“Do not distress yourself, Merle,”
she returned, in her sweet way; “it is
good for all of us to hear the truth sometimes.
It was foolish of me to say that.
I only mean that in our house it is very
difficult not to follow the world’s custom.”</p>

<p>“Very difficult indeed,” I acquiesced;
but she continued to look at me thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid of saying what is
in your mind; you may speak to me
plainly, if you will. You are my children’s
nurse, but I cannot forget that
in many ways we are equals. You
never intrude this fact on my notice, but
it is none the less apparent. I know
our Sundays are terribly secular,” as I
continued silent; “sometimes I wish it
were not so, for my children’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Not for your own sake, Mrs. Morton?”</p>

<p>A distressed look came over her face.</p>

<p>“I seem to have no time to wish for
anything.”</p>

<p>“I could well believe that; but, Mrs.
Morton, it seems to me as though we
owe some duty to ourselves. If we
neglect the highest part of ourselves we
are committing a sort of mental suicide.
How often has Aunt Agatha told me
that!”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” she asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“We all need a quiet time for
thought. It always seems to me that
on Sunday one lays down one’s burthens
for a time. It is such a rest to shut out
the world for one day in the week, to
forget the harass of one’s work, to take
up higher duties, to lift one’s standard
afresh, and prove one’s armour. It is
just like abiding in the tents for shelter
and rest in the heat of battle.”</p>

<p>I had forgotten the difference in our
station, and was talking to my mistress
just as though she were Aunt Agatha.
Something seemed to compel me to
speak; I felt a strange sort of trouble
oppressing me, as though I saw a
beautiful soul wandering out of the way.
She seemed moved at my words, and it
was several minutes before she spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Your words recall the old Sundays
at my own dear home,” she observed,
presently. “Do you not love Sundays
in the country, Merle? The very birds
seem to sing more sweetly, and the stillness
of which you speak seems in the very
air. My Sundays were very different
then. We lived near the church, and
we could hear the chiming of the bells
as we walked through the village. I
taught in the Sunday-school; I recollect
some of the children’s names now.
Father always liked us to go to the
evening service. I remember, too, we
invariably sang Bishop Ken’s evening
hymn. One evening a little robin found
its way into the church. I remember
Mr. Andrews, our vicar, was just reading
that verse, ‘Yea, the sparrow has
found her a house, and the swallow a
nest for herself, where she may lay her
young,’ when we looked up and saw
the little creature fluttering round the
chancel. Oh, those sweet old Sundays!”
And here she broke off and sighed.</p>

<p>I thought it best to say no more, and
leave her to those tender memories. A
word in season may do much, but I was
young, and had no right to teach with
authority. I suppose she understood
my reticence, for she looked at me very
kindly as she rose from her seat.</p>

<p>“It does me good to come up here,
Merle; I always have a more rested
feeling when I go down to my duties.
If I did not feel that they were real
duties that called me I should be very
unhappy.”</p>

<p>She bade her children good-night, and
left the nursery. What made me take
up my Bible, I wonder, and read the
following verse! “In this thing the
Lord pardon Thy servant, that when
my master goeth into the house of
Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth
on my hand, and I bow myself in
the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon
Thy servant this thing.”</p>

and might gain for you perhaps £30 per annum.
But these are to be weighed against two serious
drawbacks—extreme youth, and consequent lack of
weight and authority with your pupils, and complete
lack of experience in reading their several characters
and bodily condition, and the modifications and
changes of method requisite to suit these different
subjects under your training. Teaching lessons is
but a small part of the duties of a governess. The
characters of her pupils have to be carefully read and
moulded, their manners and habits trained according
to those of polite society, and she should discover
what natural gifts should be cultivated and what
studies should be remitted, more or less. At sixteen
you are scarcely more than a child yourself, and quite
such in inexperience. Thus, you are really only fit
for a visiting governess, teaching under the direction
of the mother; and if you take a residential situation,
it could only be at a low salary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Desiree.</span>—If you wish to prepare yourself for being a
nurse at home, we recommend you a careful study of
a small manual, often named for the purpose, “Sick
Nursing at Home” (L. U. Gill, 170, Strand, W.C.).
When you could be examined on that you will have
made great progress towards efficiency. You do not
name your age. Had you done so, we could have
advised you further.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daughter of Gentleman Farmer</span> (Dublin).—If
you have artistic taste and can design, and, in
addition, have a delicate touch, write either to the
City and Guilds Technical Institute, Exhibition-road,
South Kensington, S.W., or to the Polytechnic,
Regent-street, W., where classes for wood-carving
are held. Address the secretary in both cases. If
you think of training for the teaching of children
under the Kindergarten system, there are many
schools for the purpose. Write to the Misses
Crombie, 21, Stockwell-road, S.W., with a view to
entering the college established by the British and
Foreign School Society. Or else to the secretary,
Home and Colonial Training College, in Gray’s Inn-road,
W.C.</p>

<h3>MUSIC.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>M. L. P.—It is to be regretted on your own account,
if not on that of others, who might be glad to avail
themselves of your musical society, that you should
contemplate giving it up without first inducing someone
to take your place. Your society, we imagine,
is already entered in a directory of girls’ clubs,
shortly to appear, and too late now to be omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man’s Darling.</span>—You will often find songs in
our paper. It is sad to hear that you “get wild
with your nose,” which at seven or eight o’clock p.m.
“gets puggy.” What can that mean? As we cannot
hope for the pleasure of witnessing such a phenomenon,
we advise you to consult your mother about
it. If an hereditary “pug,” we do not understand
why it should be otherwise during the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Courtleroy.</span>—We are obliged to you for the information
you give respecting the tonic sol-fa system. It
was invented by Miss Glover, of Norwich, and afterwards
improved upon by John Curwen, in about the
year 1847; but the Tonic Sol-fa College was established
a year earlier than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Romola.</span>—The class of music known us the “cantata”
was invented by Barbara Strozzi, a Venetian
lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Greek Girl.</span>—1. The song you name is one in the
Christy Minstrels’ collection, and is, we believe, one
of the late Stephen Foster’s, who died in March,
1864. He was the originator of that class of music.
You write English so well, that we should have
thought you a countrywoman. 2. If you wish to see
the prettiest parts of England, you should visit some
parts of Surrey, Devonshire, Derbyshire, Cumberland,
Westmoreland, and portions of Wales. We
are glad you are partial to the English, and that you
appreciate our series of articles on good breeding
and etiquette. Your writing is good, and thoroughly
English.</p>
</div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Popsey.</span>—Perhaps Blackwood’s “holdfast” would
prove satisfactory in securing the scraps on your
screen. We imagine that you are not very careful
in brushing the gum or paste quite over the corners
that you complain curl up. Very little of the above-named
“holdfast” will be required to make the
scraps adhere firmly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tennyson.</span>—The precise origin of the office of “Poet
Laureate” does not appear to be known. There
was a <i>Versificator Regis</i> in the reign of Henry
III. Chaucer was Poet Laureate by his own appointment,
and he subsequently received an annuity
from Richard II. Some twenty-one poets succeeded
him in the office. The immediate predecessor of Tennyson
was William Wordsworth, and he was succeeded
by Dr. Robert Southey. Tennyson, who
was born in 1809, received the appointment in 1850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice Grey.</span>—See page 519, vol. vi., for description
and illustration for a supper table. Add some
chickens and a ham, and you could make it do for
your plain wedding breakfast. The bride and
bridegroom sit together and lead the way to the
dining-room, and place themselves in the centre of
the long table opposite the wedding cake. The
father of the bride takes the bridegroom’s mother,
and seats himself next his daughter, and the bridegroom’s
father takes the bride’s mother, who sits
next the bridegroom. The bridesmaids generally sit
opposite the bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marcelle’s</span> question was answered on page 704,
vol. vii. The poem, “Pleasures of Memory,” is by
Samuel Rogers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Delicate Country Lassie.</span>—1. We have read your
nice little letter with much interest and sympathy.
It is pleasant to hear that our advice has been
helpful to you, and we only wish your health would
improve. But we think you might lay the matter
before God in faith, and ask Him to cure you and
raise you up, according to the promise, “the prayer
of faith shall save the sick.” See St. James v. 15,
and Matt. viii. 17. 2. The 26th June, 1874, was a
Friday. Write to the secretary, Lifeboat Institution,
14, John-street, Adelphi, W.C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Earnest Inquirer.</span>—It is impossible for us to tell
you when the Government will legislate in behalf of
shorter hours work for shop assistants. To work
from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on ordinary days, and from
9 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Saturdays, is slave-driving
indeed. We can only wonder that ostensibly respectable
tradesmen could be guilty of treating their
assistants in so cruel a manner, and that in a
Christian country. They ought not to need legal
coercion in a matter of mere humanity.</p>

<p>E. A. A. B.—Almeida is the name of one of the
strongest fortresses of Portugal, in the Province of
Beira, and on the north-east frontier of Spain. It
was taken by the Spaniards in 1762, and afterwards
surrendered. Massena captured it from the British
in 1810, and Wellington re-took it the following year,
and restored it to Portugal. As the Spaniards had
once captured the fortress, they naturally commemorated
their victory and great acquisition by naming
an avenue after it in Madrid. You spelt the name
incorrectly.</p>

<p>D. M.—The origin of the designation of those days
beginning on July 3rd and ending on August 11th,
as dog days, has nothing to do with dogs becoming
mad from the heat and lack of water. In the time
of the ancient astronomers, the heliacal rising of
Sirius, the dog-star, occurred in July, and superstition
attached to his rising the rabies in dogs. But
this was quite untrue, for this disease is not produced
even under tropical suns in mid-summer, where the
animals are not inoculated with the virus of one
already itself bitten. If no biting were permitted
there would be no more mad dogs. Besides, it is
not during the excessive heat of July that dogs do go
mad, the colder months of winter and early spring
being far more usual seasons for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christina S.</span>—Perhaps you set yourself too much to
do. In the Christian life it is often so, and then you
are discouraged because you fail. The first rule
seems to be, To love your brother as yourself; for if
you cannot act unselfishly, kindly, and affectionately
towards those you see, you cannot love the God you
have not seen. Begin with thinking of everybody
around you first, and in that love and service, combined
with faith, you will, in time, see God, for God
is love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Anxious One, Primrose.</span>—There is a valuable
book published by the R. T. S., 56, Paternoster-row,
E.C., “A New Introduction to the Study of
the Bible,” by Barrows, which you would find it an
advantage to study. But do not make it the habit
of your mind to fret about dogma; turn to the
practical side of religion, and serve the Lord Christ
by your daily life and conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primrose League.</span>—Having given your sister the best
advice, you are not bound to do more, but try to win
her by love with patience. It would be better for
her to have a governess at home than to go to
school.</p>

<p>M. A. B. Z. E.—Look at any of our completed volumes
and you will find the index is a list of the subjects
written upon in the G.O.P., with the page on which
they are to be found added. The first of April, 1872,
was a Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Englishwoman in Russia.</span>—You will need to
write many stories and to gain much experience in
writing before you produce one fit for publication.
We could not give advice about publication; but you
will find the addresses of all London publishers in a
London directory; and you must follow the example
of Charlotte Brontë, and all our best writers almost,
<i>i.e.</i>, to try and try again until you gain a hearing.
There is no royal road to success. You would probably
find Vincent’s “Dictionary of Biography” in
Haydn’s series a useful book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shining Light</span> (?).—“R. S. V. P.” are the initials of
the French sentence “Répondez s’il vous plait,” <i>i.e.</i>,
reply if you please. They are put in the corners of
invitations to various entertainments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Happy Minnie.</span>—The inner skin of the broad bean
pod is said to be a cure for warts, if rubbed on gently
several times a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene Aynsley.</span>—1. In England drive to the left, but on
the Continent and in America one keeps to the right.
We do not know the custom in New Zealand, but
doubtless it is the English. 2. Can you not get a small
book on fancy knitting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rex.</span>—Certainly call on and visit your pupils’
mothers, if invited. You do not need any other introduction.
Unless introduced to the friends met in the
street, it is well to walk on a short distance and
wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ein Unartiges Madchen.</span>—1. Punch and Judy dates
its origin to one of the old mystery plays, <i>Pontius
Pilate and the Jews</i>. The story as we represent it
is attributed to Silvio Fiorillo, an Italian comedian
of the seventeenth century. The moral is decidedly
bad, as the evil is made to triumph over the good,
and defies and defeats all law and justice. 2. Slope
your writing more from right to left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One who is Waiting.</span>—The story you tell us of a
cat taking care of two chickens when her kittens
were taken from her is very wonderful; but we
believe it has its parallel in one told by Sir John
Lubbock, of a cat that brought up two ducklings,
and was distracted at seeing them take to the water.
We much approve of the wishes and feelings you
express, and you have our sympathy. We wish you
God-speed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Winifred H.</span>—1. Grey is a very delicate colour, and
probably the rain has extracted the dye, and nothing
could restore the loss but having the material redyed
in a darker shade. 2. It is not necessary that the name
of a writer should appear; but the difficulty is that
we cannot accept the articles and stories of unknown
writers. We rarely take those of authors who have
not made their names as such.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Truly Sweet Eighteen</span>” (?).—We should say that,
as a descriptive name, “Truly Vain” would be
<i>truer</i>. If you find that you earn too little by dressmaking,
perhaps you could turn your four years’
experience of that trade to good account by adding
to your acquirements that of hair-dressing, and then
you could take a situation as lady’s-maid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humble Minor.</span>—We never heard of an infant who
would not go to his mother voluntarily, unless to go
to a wet-nurse, whom he might naturally suppose, if
he could not think, was his real mother. If he have
a fearful temper, and be not a screamer from teething,
or any other pain, he should be gently corrected
for his violence. Some children scream themselves
into fits. Children should have the best and richest
<i>unwatered</i> milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One in Trouble.</span>—It is well that you only broke one
looking-glass, and that your father only tries to comfort
you. Be more careful in the future, and do not
listen to silly “prophets of evil.” Those who trust
in God’s care and commit themselves to Him in well-doing,
need not “take thought for the morrow” in
an anxious way. It would be a want of faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oak Tree.</span>—Do as your mother wishes. You are not
yet nineteen, and are under her authority. But
perhaps she might spare you to go out for a few
hours daily, to take children out for a walk, and
teach them to write, read, sew, and some few other
lessons. If not, she might let you assist in some
shop where the hours were not long. Perhaps you
might hold a little class of children at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charity.</span>—1. We do not know to what your mother
refers by that name, but you will find allusions to
the “Book of Life” in the Epistle to the Philippians
iv. 3, and in the Book of Revelations iii. 5, and in
five more places. 2. If you wish some day to be a
doctor, begin by studying a shilling manual called
“Sick Nursing at Home” (Gill, 170, Strand, W.C.),
and then join an ambulance class.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ella Mary.</span>—What are known as “Mystery plays”
are referred for their origin to the pilgrims who
journeyed to the East in the eleventh century. The
earliest known in England took place at Dunstable
early in the following century. The oldest extant
dates to the reign of Edward III. The “Chester
Mysteries” date back to 1327. Those of the French
only commenced in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Owner of “Muff.”</span>—1. We do not undertake to
teach quadrupeds, though we endeavour to teach
bipeds, but these latter only provided they be not
“muffs,” as that would be beyond our patience,
and perhaps our ability, for there are more “muffs”
than those that walk on four legs! 2. The 1st of September,
1873, was a Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phlox.</span>—Fidgets in the legs usually arise from acidity,
and perhaps indigestion. You should take some
anti-acid, such as magnesia, before going to bed, if
suffering much. A doctor should prescribe for you,
as you seem out of health. Avoid sweet things, and
any food that produces acidity in the system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pale Face.</span>—We do not know what could now be
done to give you a pair of straight legs, unless you
could have them exchanged, and screw on a pair of
wooden ones. Wear a full skirt, and the defect may
be concealed to a great extent, especially if you take
pains in walking well.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
